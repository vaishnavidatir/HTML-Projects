# Javascript-Projects
I created this repository for javascript projects, which I completed during my course completion on greatlearning and I will also include my recent project too 


# Installation and Run :
**For Windows OS**
  * For this project I used sublime text as editor,You can install it from [here](https://filehippo.com/download_sublime_text/).
  * After you done installation open sublime text editor ,before this create one separate folder as javascript-project on desktop for ease of saving project at one place ,after       opening editor go inside file and choose open folder and from there select javascrpt-project folder and here to go,now you can create new file from file and save that file         with filename.html(filename you can choose).
  *  write program there ,save it  and on right clicking copy the file path and paste it in chrome ,you will get output ,whenever you do changes in program first save it and then      refresh chrome file path , **the program not going to show any output if there any error in program or you missed something **.
